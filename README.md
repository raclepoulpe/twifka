# Kafka Producer / Consumer connected to Twitter API

In this tutorial, we will play with the new [Kafka service](https://www.ovhcloud.com/fr/public-cloud/apache-kafka) offered by [OVHcloud](https://www.ovhcloud.com/).

We will use the [Twitter v2 API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api) to produce data and then send it to the Kafka cluster.

We will finish by creating a small monitoring tool in [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash).

Note: In a future release, we will develop a web page that will expose the Kafka cluster stream.
